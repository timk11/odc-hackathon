[EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/timk11/odc-hackathon/blob/main/EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection.ipynb) is the same file that I originally uploaded to https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:92067fe74892465ad77bb989abe48f67b76dfbb72bf547caa1805dfccb195f88 prior to the submission deadline. This is a Python notebook and can be opened with Visual Studio Code. A more easily readable version of the notebook can be found at https://nbviewer.org/github/timk11/odc-hackathon/blob/main/EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection.ipynb.

[EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection-v2.ipynb](https://github.com/timk11/odc-hackathon/blob/main/EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection-v2.ipynb) is a slightly shorter version of the notebook. The only change here is the removal of 3 cells that served only to display a very long list. (Specifically, cells 81, 84 and 275 were removed. The comment above cell 85 refers to the deleted cell 84. VS Code and Anaconda will compress long lists for viewing, whereas nbviewer does not.) An easily readable of this notebook can be found at https://nbviewer.org/github/timk11/odc-hackathon/blob/main/EDA_for_Sybil_attack_detection-v2.ipynb. I recommend going to this link first.

I have sent supplementary material separately to @epowell101 which gives more specifics on groups of accounts that are of interest, including adding additional parameters from the donor_df dataframe to the large set of single-first-funder dataframes presented earlier in this notebook, and including a brief look at data from the current Alpha Grants Round.
